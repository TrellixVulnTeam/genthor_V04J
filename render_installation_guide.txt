Preliminary:

-Install the following packages:

# % you must have root to install these packages (if you are on mh_17 they are already installed)

apt-get install bison flex

apt-get install -y -q libgl1-mesa-dev

apt-get install -y -q libtiff4-dev

apt-get install -y -q libsdl1.2-dev



-Copy this obj_Bscript.py in genthor to your ~/.skdata directory:

cp genthor/genthor/modeltools/obj_Bscript.py ~/.skdata/   (make ~/.skdata if it doesn't exist)



Blender

-Download, extract and install prebuilt blender from website.

http://www.blender.org/download/get-blender/
Choose the right operation system and copy the downloading link
Use wget to install in shell
If installing on mh17 (linux 64), the link is http://download.blender.org/release/Blender2.68/blender-2.68a-linux-glibc211-x86_64.tar.bz2

-Rewrite so that you are installing to a specific directory (let's use ~/renderer) 
To install blender, first make a new folder called 'render' in HOME directory: mkdir render
Then, unzip using the proper tar command based on file type: tar jxf filename.tar.bz2
It doesn't matter where you unzip panda.

-Copy the folders io_scene_egg and io_scene_obj from Blender's addons to the directory containing genthor.
# all paths are absolute
# [PATH_TO_GENTHOR] means the folder that contains the genthor module, setup.py, etc

# # no file called io_scene_egg, cannot run
cp -r ~/[PATHTOBLENDERINSTALL]/2.68/scripts/addons/io_scene_egg ~/[PATHTOGENTHOR]
# # cannot run the above code. This will cause problem later when redering images!

cp -r ~/[PATHTOBLENDERINSTALL]/2.68/scripts/addons/io_scene_obj ~/[PATHTOGENTHOR]

Then link /bin/blender to your install location

ln -s ~/PATHTOBLENDERINSTALL/blender ~/bin/blender

Panda

-Download panda from source.
# wget url
https://www.panda3d.org/download/panda3d-1.8.1/panda3d-1.8.1.tar.gz 

-Unzip using tar -zxvf filename.tar.gz

-Make using
# make sure you are in the folder where you installed/extracted panda before you run makepanda
python makepanda/makepanda.py --everything --no-vision

You can then install it in the same location (path to install has to be the same as path you called makepanda)

python makepanda/installpanda.py --prefix=/[PATHYOUWANTTOINSTALLIN]

-Edit panda's Config.prc file (locate or find Config.prc, nano or vi the file) so it looks like this 

#load-display pandagl
#load-display pandadx9
#load-display pandadx8
#load-display pandagles
load-display p3tinydisplay



Set sys path of Panda

-add [PATH_TO_PANDA_INSTALL]/usr/local/share/panda3d and [PATH_TO_PANDA_INSTALL]/usr/local/share/panda3d to your python path using

export PYTHON_PATH='~/panda3d-1.8.1/usr/local/lib/panda3d':'~/panda3d-1.8.1/usr/local/share/panda3d'

-then add this line to your .profile so this is done automatically at login


In ipython
-import genthor.datasets as gd
# When you run genthor for the first time, it will need to load background and models. 
# You can do this by:
meta=dataset.meta
# after define your models, you will need to load models
dataset.get_models()
